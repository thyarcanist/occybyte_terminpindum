# Occult Technology

 Heard you wanted to know more about the Terminium Compendium, I've created an interactive environment.
 Or at least, I'm trying too.

 

Welcome to Nil's Computational Notebook

You might be wondering... so, what's an Occybyte? It's simple. 
It stands for occult byte.

Here are the goals and objectives for using this are pretty simple, they are:

    Learn how to create .ipynb files and correctly use them inside of this lovely IDE.
    Learn how to integrate and use python code within' this-- had I known about this sooner...
    Complete three projects that will use data collected from the Occybyte Division of the Nexus.
        Learn more about the Godless and Godliving dichtomy. (Includes: Interactive Map Creation, utilizing data visualization libraries.)
        Discover the increase in the arcane users within' the planet archeros.
        Troubleshoot asteriod and planet fracking and how we import and export these resources to realms in need.
        Create a sentiment and theme analysis model for understanding the recurring motifs and ideas from procured documents.
        Automated Lore Expansion of the Librarires of Xibir & perhaps likely, predictive plot development.

Truth is-- we can be here all day figuring out what to do and how will we do it; so, let's go to business!
