This should simulate the planet creation that was somewhat achieved inside of the TerminusWorldClassification python in one of the last projects. This time, we will be creating planet classes / structs using the SOL System as a basis.

The numerical values should come from this

GAS
- Jupiter
- Saturn
- Uranus

WATER
- Neptune

SATELITTE
- Moon
- Gandymede
- Pluto

SOLID
- Mercury
- Venus
- Earth
- Mars

The main part of the interactive python notebook will be the Terminus Space Station, which will have a SUPPLY, DEMAND. 
SUPPLY AND DEMAND are calculated via:
STORED, EXCESS, CONSUMATION RATE.

In one of the past projects we determined that the Terminus has ~10K population.
