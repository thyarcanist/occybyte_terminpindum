# 'Occult' / IP-Based Technology

Heard you wanted to know more about the Terminium Compendium. I've created an interactive environment, or at least, I'm trying to.

Welcome to Curator Nil's Computational Notebook!

You might be wondering... so, what's an Occybyte? It's simple. It stands for "occult byte".

Here are the goals and objectives for using this are straightforward:

- Learn how to create .ipynb files and correctly use them inside this lovely IDE. [✓]
- Learn how to integrate and use Python code within this—had I known about this sooner... [✓]
- Complete at least three projects that will use data collected from the Occybyte Division of the Nexus:
    - Learn more about the Godless and Godliving dichotomy. [✓]
        - (Includes: Interactive Map Creation, utilizing data visualization libraries.) []
    - Discover the increase in arcane users on the planet Archeros. []
    - Troubleshoot asteroid and planet fracking and how we import and export these resources to realms in need. []
    - Create a sentiment and theme analysis model for understanding recurring motifs and ideas from procured documents. [✓]
    - Automated Lore Expansion of the Libraries of Xibir & perhaps predictive plot development. []
- Created an prepared various datasets to use for fine-tuning and training. [✓]
