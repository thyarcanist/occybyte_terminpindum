    "What got me back into learning about this is because I learned how the diffusion models worked for image creation based generative models such as DALL-E and Midjourney; it's really, really neat. It basically embeds the pixels using an attention mechanism and erases and then it does the reverse to create a new image. It's basically like taking a normal image, turning it into CRT fuzz/white noise, then overtime you are generating an actual image based on a prompt.<br>\n",
